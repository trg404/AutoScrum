re-align the team


----values out of it (subtexts)
sparks converstions after the daily and side bars
start to get it away from being a unload point for talking 
update daily to keep the flow of communication up
happens more organically doesn't have to be aroudn the room
using walking the board to stop people from eyes glazing over
usnig the point where peoples eyes are glazed over as a point to say this is a side bar moment.
using the idea of hating meetings to push the conciseness of the meeting.
too many distractions 
But having the defiintion of done and acceptance criteria for each story also written on the board.
goes smoother with mutual trust.
going over the definition of done and determining definition.
Using at an outlet to push out responsibility of facilitation to each person.

bad subtext -----
No other use for talking outside the meeting
