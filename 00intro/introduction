So I've given a few talks over the years, I think this is the first time I'll have code to go with it.

I'm Mark, Trog on IRC and I'm going to save your company millions by showing how to automate the scrum teams.

I'm going to go over all the things you'll need to convert your company over to scrum. I'll do it open source too. all the code is posted on github.

But lets start off with the basics what I'll be covering. 

I'll go over the roles in scrum, 
and then the ceremonies, 

at the end there will be time for questions and heckling, so please hold it till the end. 
I don't want to do crowd work at a conference.
